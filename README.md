# 👋 Hi there! I'm [Your Name]

I'm a Full Stack Developer with a passion for building modern, scalable, and user-focused web applications. I specialize in both frontend and backend technologies, and I enjoy working across the entire development stack — from designing responsive UIs to deploying APIs in production.

## 🧰 Tech Toolbox

Here are some of the technologies I work with regularly:

- **Frontend:** I build clean and interactive user interfaces using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Next.js.
- **Backend:** I create secure and efficient backend systems using Node.js (with Express) or Python (with Django or FastAPI).
- **Databases:** I’ve worked with both SQL and NoSQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.
- **DevOps & Tools:** I use Git for version control, Docker for containerization, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows. I’m also familiar with deploying apps to platforms like AWS, Vercel, and Heroku.
